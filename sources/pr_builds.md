# CI Project Dashboard

This page walks through the details on the Project Dashboard. You get here by clicking on a specific project from your [CI Dashboard](ci_dashboard)

Shippable will integrate with github to show your pull request status on
CI. Whenever a pull request is opened for your repo, we will run the
build for the respective pull request and notify you about the status.
You can decide whether to merge the request or not, based on the status
shown. If you accept the pull request, Shippable will run one more build
for the merged repo and will send email notifications for the merged
repo. To rerun a pull request build, go to your project's page -\> Pull
Request tab and then click on the **Build this Pull Request** button.
