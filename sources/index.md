# Overview

## What is Shippable?

Shippable is a SaaS platform that lets you easily add Continuous
Integration/Deployment to your Github and Bitbucket(Git) repositories.
It is lightweight, super simple to setup, and runs your builds and tests
faster than any other service. After building and testing your code, you
can deploy it to any PaaS provider like Heroku & OpenShift and also to
VMs, bare metal, OpenStack clusters, or any major infrastructure
provider.

Shippable uses **Build Minions** - i.e. docker based containers - to run
your workloads. Docker is the fastest growing linux container solution
and this will light up some cool scenarios like portability and
versioning in the coming weeks.

Common use cases for Shippable include:

-  Automating the packaging and deployment of web applications
-  Automated testing and continuous integration/deployment

> **Note**
>
> Shippable is 100% free to use, even for private
> repositories.
