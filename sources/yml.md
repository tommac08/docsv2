# Configuring Your YML

Your shippable.yml file tells us about your project and how to run your
builds and tests. This file should be at the root of your repository in
order to build the repo with Shippable. Your yml can be as minimal or as
customized as necessary, depending on the project.

To help Travis CI users quickly test our platform, we support
.travis.yml natively, so you will not need a shippable.yml in addition.
Most tags in your .travis.yml are supported if the corresponding feature
is available on Shippable.

At a minimum, Shippable needs to have your language and build version
specified in the yml. We will default to the most common commands if
commands for the other sections are not specified.

The descriptions below are generic to all build environments and all
languages. If you are looking for language specific tags, please refer
to our [language guides](languages/index.html) for more information.

## Build Flow

When we receive a build trigger through a webhook or manual run, we
execute the following steps:

1.  Clone/Pull the project from Github or Bitbucket. This depends on
    whether the minion is in pristine state or not
2.  `cd` into the workspace
3.  Checkout the commit that is being built
4.  Run the `before_install` commands. This is typically used to prep
    your minion and install/update any packages
5.  Run `install` section. This should be used to install any project
    specific libraries or packages
6.  Run `before_script` commands. Create any folders and unzip files
    that might be needed for testing. Some users also restore DBs, copy
    environment variables, etc. here
7.  Run the `script` commands. This runs the build and all your tests
8.  Run either `after_success` or `after_failure` commands, depending on
    the result of your build. after\_success can be used to deploy to
    any supported cloud provider
9.  Run `after_script` command

Build status is determined based on the outcome of the above steps. They
need to return an exit code of `0` to be marked as success. Everything
else is treated as a failure.

Any errors in `after_script` will not affect the status of the build.

## YML Sections

### build_image

By default, all Shippable builds use the image shippable/minv2. This is
a huge image and comes pre-installed with all popular language versions,
along with all supported tools and services. If you want to use the
default image, you do not need the `build_image` tag in your yml.

The recommended approach is to use one of our [language specific
images](languages/images.md).

Please note that language specific images do not have any tools and services pre-installed, so you will need to install these in your yml.

### language

You should specify the programming language and versions of the language
you’d like to build against. You can test against multiple versions with
a single commit by adding more in the versions section.

```yml
# language setting
language: node_js

# version numbers, testing against two versions of node
node_js:
    - 0.10.25
    - 0.11
```

### before_install

The `before_install` section is used to prep your build minion with any
packages or dependencies that are not already pre-installed.

For example, if you require docco and coffee\_script for your Node.js
app, you would do the following -

```yml
# npm install runs by default but shown here for illustrative purposes
before_install:
    - npm install docco
    - npm install coffee-script
```

If nothing is specified in this section, we will attempt to install
dependencies for your app in an idiomatic way for the language (such as
invoking rake for ruby, or pip for python)

### install

The install section lets you install packages and dependencies that are
specific to your project. This is useful if your project uses non
standard tools.

```yml
#install java project dependencies with ant
install: ant deps
```

### script

The `script` section is where the magic happens. In this section, you
can specify the main build commands for your project. Again, if you list
nothing here, your build minion will attempt to make a logical choice
based on your specified language.

```yml
# Running npm test to run your test cases
script:
    - npm test
```

You can run any script file as part of your configuration, as long as it
has a valid shebang command and the right `chmod` permissions.

```yml
# script file
script: ./minions/do_something.sh
```

If you want to prevent shippable from using the default build command
you can add following:

```yml
# script file
script:
- true #or any custom command
```

### after_success or after_failure

These sections are used to specify commands to be called after the build
succeeds or fails. For example, for a Java project using Cobertura, this
section can be used to clean up files created during instrumentation.

```yml
after_success:
   - mvn clean cobertura:cobertura
```

Commonly, `after_success` section is also used to add deployment scripts

```yaml
after_success:
    - test -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa.heroku || ssh-keygen -y -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa > ~/.ssh/id_rsa.heroku && heroku keys:add ~/.ssh/id_rsa.heroku
    - git remote -v | grep ^heroku || heroku git:remote --ssh-git --app $APP_NAME
    - git push -f heroku master
```

### after_script

This is the last user defined section to be executed, and can be used to
perform tasks after the build and tests are complete, like generating a
coverage repor

## Useful YML Tags

### Caching Minions

Shippable does not cache dependencies between builds. Each build will
run on a fresh minion and as soon as the build finishes execution, the
minion will be deleted. However, we also understand that installing
dependencies for each build will take more time and it affects your
build speed . Hence we have a caching feature that helps you to cache
dependencies between builds. Add the following line to your yml file to
enable caching:

```yaml
cache: true
```

Before the build, we will check for the flag **cache: true** and if it
exists, the entire minion will be cached if the build succeeds and the
cached minion will be reused for further builds.

You can use the **[reset_minion]** tag in your commit message to reset
the minion. We will clear all the cached dependencies and packages, when
we see a [reset_minion] tag and your build will run on a fresh minion.
Once this build finishes execution, we will cache the minion once again
so that further builds can run using the cached minion.

Caching is done per build host, so it might take a few builds for all
our hosts to get the cached minion. Additional details on caching can be
found on our [blog](http://blog.shippable.com/container-caching) .

**command collections** `shippable.yml` supports collections under each
tag. This is nothing more than YML functionality and we will run it one
command at a time.

```yaml
# collection scripts
script:
 - ./minions/do_something.sh
 - ./minions/do_something_else.sh
```

In the example above, our minions will run `./minions/do_something.sh`
and then run `./minions/do_something-else.sh`. The only requirement is
that all of these operations return a `0` exit code. Else the build will
fail.

### shippable_retry

Sometimes npm install may fail due to the intermittent network issues
and affects your build execution. To avoid this, **shippable_retry**
function will try to install the command again. It will check the return
code of a command and if it is non-zero, then it will re-try to install
up to three times.

**shippable_retry** functionality is available for all default
installation commands and it will re-try to install on failure. You can
also use this functionality for any custom installation from external
resources. For example:

```yaml
before_install:
    - shippable_retry sudo apt-get update
    - shippable_retry sudo apt-get install something
```

### Git Submodules

Shippable supports git submodules. This is a cool functionality of
breaking your projects down into manageable chunks. We automatically
initialize the `.gitmodules` file in the root of the repo.

> **Note**
>
> If you are using private repos, add the deploy keys so that our minion
> ssh keys are allowed to pull from the repo. This can be done via
> shippable.com

If its your own public repos then do this

```python
# for public modules use
git://github.com/someuser/somelibrary.git

# for private modules use
git@github.com:someuser/somelibrary.git
```

If you would like to turn submodules off completely -

```yaml
# for public modules use
git:
 submodules: false
```

### Common Environment Variables

The following environment variables are available for every build. You
can use these in your scripts if required:

- BRANCH : Name of branch being built
- BASE_BRANCH : Name of the target branch into which the pull request
  changes will be merged
- BUILD_NUMBER : Build number for current build
- BUILD_URL : Direct URL link to the build output
- CI : true
- CONTINUOUS_INTEGRATION : true
- COMMIT : Commit id that is being built and tested
- COMPARE_URL : A link to GitHub/BitBucket's comparision view for the
  push
- DEBIAN_FRONTEND : noninteractive
- HEAD_BRANCH: Name of the most recently committed branch
- JOB_ID : id of job in Shippable
- LANG : en_US.UTF-8
- LAST_SUCCESSFUL_BUILD_TIMESTAMP : Timestamp of the last
  successful build in seconds. This will be set to **false** for the
  first build or for the build with no prior successful builds
- LC_ALL : en_US.UTF-8
- LC_CTYPE : en_US.UTF-8
- MERB_ENV : test
- PATH : \$HOME/bin:\$PATH
- PULL_REQUEST : Pull request number if the job is a pull request. If
  not, this will be set to **false**
- RACK_ENV : test
- RAILS_ENV : test
- REPO_NAME : Name of the repository currently being built
- REPOSITORY_URL : URL of your Github or Bitbucket repository
- SERVICE_SKIP : false
- SHIPPABLE : true
- SHIPPABLE_ARCHIVE : true
- SHIPPABLE_BUILD_ID : id of build in Shippable
- SHIPPABLE_MYSQL_BINARY : "/usr/bin/mysqld_safe"
- SHIPPABLE_MYSQL_CMD : "\$SHIPPABLE_MYSQL_BINARY"
- SHIPPABLE_POSTGRES_VERSION : "9.2"
- SHIPPABLE_POSTGRES_BINARY :
  "/usr/lib/postgresql/\$SHIPPABLE_POSTGRES_VERSION/bin/postgres"
- SHIPPABLE_POSTGRES_CMD : "sudo -u postgres
  \$SHIPPABLE_POSTGRES_BINARY -c
  "config_file=/etc/postgresql/\$SHIPPABLE_POSTGRES_VERSION/main/postgresql.conf""
- SHIPPABLE_VE_DIR : "\$HOME/build_ve/python/2.7"
- USER : shippable

### User Specified Environment Variables

You can set your own environment variables in the yml. Every statement
of this command will trigger a separate build with that specific version
of the environment variables.

```yaml
# environment variable
env:
 - FOO=foo BAR=bar
 - FOO=bar BAR=foo
```

> **Note**
>
> Env variables can create an exponential number of builds when combined
> with `jdk` & `rvm , node_js etc.` i.e. it is multiplicative

In this setting **4 individual builds** are triggered in a build group

```yaml
# npm builds
node_js:
  - 0.10.24
  - 0.8.14
env:
  - FOO=foo BAR=bar
  - FOO=bar BAR=foo
```

**Secure environment variables**

Shippable allows you to encrypt the environment variable definitions and
keep your configurations private using **secure** tag. Go to the org
dashboard or individual dashboard page from where you have enabled your
project and click on **ENCRYPT ENV VARIABLE** button on the top right
corner of the page. Enter the env variable and its value in the text box
as shown below.

```
name=abc
```

Click on the encrypt button and copy the encrypted output string and add
it to your yml file as shown below:

```yaml
env:
  secure: <encrypted output>
```

To encrypt multiple environment variables and use them as part of a
single build, enter the environment variable definitions in the text box
as shown below

```
name1="abc" name2="xyz"
```

This will give you a single encrypted output that you can embed in your
yml file.

You can also combine encrypted output and clear text environments using
**global** tag.

```yaml
env:
  global:
    - FOO="bar"
    - secure: <encrypted output>
```

To encrypt multiple environment variables separately, configure your yml
file as shown below:

```yaml
env:
  global:
    #encrypted output of first env variable
    - secure: <encrypted output>
    #encrypted output of second env variable
    - secure: <encrypted output>
  matrix:
    #encrypted output of third env variable
    - secure: <encrypted output>
```

> **Note**
>
> Due to the security risk of exposing your secure variables, we do not
> decrypt secure variables for pull request from the forks of public
> projects. Secure variable decryption is limited to the pull request
> triggered from the branches on the same repository. And the decrypted
> secured variables are also not displayed in the script tab for
> security reasons.

### Include & Exclude Branches

By default, Shippable builds all branches for enabled repositories as
long as they have a shippable.yml at the root.

You can change this build only specific branches using the include and
exclude sections in your yml. The specific branch that is being included
or excluded needs to have this configuration, and not just the master
branch.

This is because Shippable works as follows - we get a webhook for an
enabled repository letting us know something has changed in a specific
branch. We read the shippable.yml from that branch and then trigger a
build based on that. So if your shippable.yml in the develop branch does
not contain the exclude section, we will trigger a build irrespective of
what's in the yml in master branch.

Here is a sample of the include/exclude config -

```yaml
# exclude
branches:
  except:
    - test1
    - experiment2

# include
branches:
  only:
    - stage
    - prod
```

### Build Matrix

This is another powerful feature that Shippable has to offer. You can
trigger multiple different test passes for a single code push. You might
want to test against different versions of ruby, or different aspect
ratios for your Selenium tests or best yet, just different jdk versions.
You can do it all with Shippable's matrix build mechanism.

```yaml
rvm:
  - 1.8.7 # (current default)
  - 1.9.2
  - 1.9.3
  - rbx
  - jruby
  - ruby-head
  - ree
gemfile:
  - gemfiles/Gemfile.rails-2.3.x
  - gemfiles/Gemfile.rails-3.0.x
  - gemfiles/Gemfile.rails-3.1.x
  - gemfiles/Gemfile.rails-edge
env:
  - ISOLATED=true
  - ISOLATED=false
```

The above example will fire 36 different builds for each push. Whoa!
Need more minions?

### Exclude

It is also possible to exclude a specific version using exclude tag.
Configure your yml file as shown below to exclude a specific version.

```yaml
matrix:
  exclude:
    - rvm: 1.9.2
```

### Include

You can also configure your yml file to include entries into the matrix
with include tag.

```yaml
matrix:
  include:
    - rvm: 2.0.0
      gemfile: gemfiles/Gemfile.rails-3.0.x
      env: ISOLATED=false
```

### Allow-failures

Allowed failures are items in your build matrix that are allowed to fail
without causing the entire build to be shown as failed. You can define
allowed failures in the build matrix as follows:

```yaml
matrix:
  allow_failures:
    - rvm: 1.9.3
```

---

## Services

Shippable offers a host of pre-installed services to make it easy to run
your builds. In addition to these you can install other services also by
using the `install` tag of `shippable.yml`.

All the services are turned off by default and can be turned on by using
the `services:` tag.

## Addons

### Firefox

We support different firefox versions like "18.0", "19.0", "20.0",
"21.0", "22.0", "23.0", "24.0", "25.0", "26.0", "27.0", "28.0", "29.0".
To select a specific firefox version, add the following to your
shippable.yml file.

```yaml
addons:
   firefox: "21.0"
```

### Custom Host Name

You can also set up custom hostnames using the **hosts** addons. To set
up the hostnames in /etc/hosts file, add the following to your
shippable.yml file.

```yaml
addons:
   hosts:
    - google.com
    - asdf.com
```

### PostgreSQL

```yaml
# Postgre binds to 127.0.0.1 by default and is started on boot. Default username is "postgres" with no password
# Create a DB as part of before script to use it

before_script:
  - psql -c 'create database myapp_test;' -U postgres
```

Sample java code using
[PostgreSQL](https://github.com/shippableSamples/sample_java_postgres).

We support PostgreSQL 9.1, 9.2 and 9.3 versions and by default, version
9.2 is installed on our minions. Configure your yml file using
**PostgreSQL** addons to select different versions. Add the following to
your yml file to select the version 9.3.

```yaml
addons:
 postgresql : "9.3"
```

PostGIS 2.1 packages are pre-installed in our minions along with the
PostgreSQL versions 9.1, 9.2 and 9.3.

### Selenium

Selenium is not started on boot. You will have to enable it using
**services** tag and start xvfb (X Virtual Framebuffer) on display port
99.0, so that all your test suites will run on the server without a
display. Configure your yml file as shown below to start selenium server
on firefox.

```yaml
addons:
  firefox: "23.0"

services:
  - selenium

before_script:
  - "export DISPLAY=:99.0"
  - "/etc/init.d/xvfb start"
```

Selenium **2.40** is started by default. You can also select a different
version of selenium using **addons** tag. The following versions are
supported:

- 2.39
- 2.40
- 2.41
- 2.42
- 2.43
- 2.44

Choose the required version and add it to your shippable.yml file as
shown below

```yaml
addons:
  selenium: "2.43"
```

This will download the required version. You will have to include
**services** tag in your yml file to start the selenium server using the
downloaded version. Configure your yml file as shown below to start
selenium server **2.43** on firefox.

```yaml
#specify required selenium and firefox version
addons:
  selenium: "2.43"
  firefox: "27.0"

#start the selenium server
services:
  - selenium

before_script:
  - "export DISPLAY=:99.0"
  - "/etc/init.d/xvfb start"
```

Sample javascript code using
[Selenium](https://github.com/shippableSamples/sample_node_selenium) .

## Test and Code Coverage Visualization

### Test Results

To set up test result visualization for a repository.

- Output test results to shippable/testresults folder.
- Make sure test results are in junit format.

For example, here is the .yml file for a Python repo -

```yaml
before_script: mkdir -p shippable/testresults
script:
  - nosetests python/sample.py --with-xunit --xunit-file=shippable/testresults/nosetests.xml
```

Examples for other languages can be found in our
Code Samples \<samplesref\> .

### Code Coverage

To set up code coverage result visualization for a repository.

- Output code coverage output to shippable/codecoverage folder.
- Make sure code coverage output is in cobertura xml format.

For example, here is the .yml file for a Python repo -

```yaml
before_script: mkdir -p shippable/codecoverage
script:
  - coverage run --branch python/sample.py
  - coverage xml -o shippable/codecoverage/coverage.xml python/sample.py
```

Examples for other languages can be found in our Code Samples.

## Notifications

Shippable primarily supports email and irc notifications and these can
can be configured through the yml. To send Slack notifications, please
check out our [blog post](http://blog.shippable.com/devops-chat-a-simple-way-to-use-slack-notifications-with-shippable).
To send HipChat notifications, check out our [sample project for hipchat notifications](https://github.com/shippableSamples/sample-hipchat-notifications).

By default, we send email notifications to the last committer when a
build fails, or the status changes from failed to passed.

You can change the default settings for email notifications by
configuring the notifications section of your yml. You can specify the
email address(es) where you want to receive notification as well as the
criteria for when you want notifications to be sent.

### Email Notification

To send notifications to specific email addresses, replace the sample
email addresses below with the recipients' email ids in your
`shippable.yml` file.

```yaml
notifications:
    email:
        - exampleone@org.com
        - exampletwo@org.com
```

You can also specify when you want to get notified by setting the values
for on_success and on_failure keys to change|always|never. Change
means you want to be notified only when the build status changes on the
given branch. Always and never mean you want to be notified always or
never respectively.

```yaml
notifications:
     email:
         recipients:
             - exampleone@org.com
             - exampletwo@org.com
         on_success: change
         on_failure: always
```

If you do not want to get notified for any reason, you can configure
email notifications to false.

```yaml
notifications:
   email: false
```

### IRC Notification

You can also configure yml file to send build notifications to your IRC
channels.

- To specify single channel

```yaml
notifications:
   irc:  "chat.freenode.net#channel1"
```

- You can also specify multiple server channels in yml file. The
  following formats are supported:

```yaml
notifications:
  irc:
    - "chat.freenode.net#channel1"
    - "chat.freenode.net#channel2"
    - "server1#channel3"
```

```yaml
notifications:
  irc:
   channels:
     - "chat.freenode.net#channel1"
     - "chat.freenode.net#channel2"
     - "server1#channel3"
```

- By default, We will always send build notifications to the mentioned
  channels in yml. **on_success** and **on_failure** are not yet
  configurable.
- IRC notifications are turned off by default for pull request builds.
  However, you can change the default settings by adding
  **pull_requests: true** tag in your yml as shown below.

```yaml
notifications:
  irc:
   pull_requests: true
   channels:
```
