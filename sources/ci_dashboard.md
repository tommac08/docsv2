# CI Dashboard

This page walks through the subscriptions dashboard and the options available from the dashboard.


This is the **Status** page you get to when you click on a specific CI Subscription from the Shippable landing page.

## Default View

The default view when you get to the subscriptions dashboard is a list of your enabled projects. The view includes information about the following:

- Who enabled the project and when
- The branch for the project. Clicking on the branch will take you to the [Project Dashboard](project_dashboard.md)
- Build Info: The latest build number will lead to the [build dashboard](build_dashboard.md)
- Change Set Info
- Committer Info

## Minion Usage

This indicates the number of minions or containers currently in use. It will also indicate the maximum number of containers available as per your subscription plan.
