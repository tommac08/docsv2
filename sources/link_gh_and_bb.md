# Linking your Bitbucket and GitHub Accounts

If you want to use Shippable to build both GitHub and Bitbucket repositories, you can connect the two accounts in this page to get a consolidated view of all your projects in one Shippable account.

To connect your accounts:

1. Sign in with the GitHub/BitBucket account that you want to be your primary account.
2. Click on the Account Settings icon on the top nav bar
![account_settings](images/account_settings.gif)
3. If you signed in with GitHub, you will see an option to link Bitbucket under the **Bitbucket Identity Section**. Click on that and follow the authorization flow for Bitbucket.
4. If you signed in with Bitbucket, you will see an option to link GitHub under the **GitHub Identity Section**. Click on that and follow the authorization flow for GitHub.

Once your accounts are both connected to Shippable, you should see a
consolidated list of orgs and projects in your account. You can sign in
with either of your credentials after this point.

> **Tip**
>
> To see the linked account repositories updated immediately, click on the ![force sync](images/force_sync.gif) icon on your [Account Information section](account_settings/#account-information)
