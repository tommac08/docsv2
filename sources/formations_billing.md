Before you can add containers, you need atleast one valid payment method in your account. To add a payment method to your account, follow the steps below:

- Click on the Account Settings icon on the top nav bar
- Click on the **Cards** tab
- Add a new payment method by clicking on the ![add icon](images/add_icon.gif)

### Upgrade Plan

- Make sure your plan is set to `Multi-Tenant Formation`
- Use the slider to select the number of containers you want for your formation
- The total price automatically updates to reflect the price you will pay for the number of containers chosen
- Enter your payment details
- Click the **Buy** button
- Your formation will now be upgraded to the updated number of containers

**Note:**
When you downgrade a plan or decrease the number of containers, an adjustment is applied to the next billing cycle.
