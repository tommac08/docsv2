# Account Settings

You can get to your Account Settings by clicking on the _gear_ icon on the top bar to the right. This page will explain the different options available in the Account Settings Page.

## Account Info

### Account Information

**Id:** This is your account id in Shippable. This is the id that is linked to any access tokens you create or credit cards you add to your account.

**Force Sync:** We periodically sync account info with Github and Bitbucket. Currently this is every hour. Use this button to sync your account if you would like to see any changes made upstream immediately. Example: You have been added to a new subscription as an owner/collaborator; you have new repos in github and want to see it immediately; you linked your bitbucket account to this account and want to see your bitbucket repositories right away.

### Github Identity

If you are using a Github Account to log in, this displays the github user settings.

**Public On:** This indicates that we have access to your Public Repos in Github. This is turned on by default, since signing into Shippable requires you to authorize this access on Github.

**Private On/Off:** This indicates whether Shippable has access to your Private Repos. This needs to be turned on for Shippable to run any builds on repos that are private on Github.

> **Note**
>
> It is not possible to turn OFF the Private repos, once you have given us access. That would
> require you to delete the Shippable Account and go through the sign up process again.

(see the section on linking accounts as well)

### Bitbucket Identity

If you are using a Bitbucket Account to log in, this displays the bitbucket user settings.

**All Repos ON:** Bitbucket does not separate public and private repo access, so this is turned on by default when you sign in and authorize Shippable to access Bitbucket.

(see the section below on linking accounts as well)

### Linking your Bitbucket and Github Accounts

If you want to use Shippable to build both GitHub and Bitbucket
repositories, you can connect the two accounts in this page to get a
consolidated view of all your projects in one Shippable account.

To connect your accounts -

1. Sign in with the GitHub/BitBucket account that you want to be your primary account.
2. You will go through the [authorization flow](sign_up.md) to sign in.
3. If you signed in with Github, you will see an option to link Bitbucket under the **Bitbucket Identity Section**. Click on that and follow the authorization flow for Bitbucket.
4. If you signed in with Bitbucket, you will see an option to link Github under the **Github Identity Section**. Click on that and follow the authorization flow for Github.

Once your accounts are both connected to Shippable, you should see a
consolidated list of orgs and projects in your account. You can sign in
with either of your credentials after this point.

> **Tip**
>
> Click on **Force Sync** against your Account Id if you want to see the linked account repositories immediately (see section on Account Information)

### Misc Settings

**Show Private Forks:** If you would like to track forks from your repo (you must be an owner of the repo), then set this to ON. This is OFF by default.

### Delete Account

Clicking on this will delete all account data, project data, build data and formation data from our systems.

## Integrations

This is where we collect the information needed to connect to the different services or apps that are required as part of your build or deployment workflow within Shippable. This is done once for each type of integration and can be re-used across different parts in the Shippable pipeline.

You will need this to pull or push images to Docker Hub as part of building your project. More details on using Docker Hub is [here](docker_registries.md/#docker-hub)

1. To add a new integration, click on (+)
2. **Master Integration:** Click on `Docker`
3. Enter a name for your integration. Use a distinctive name that's easy to associate to the integration and recall. `Example:docker-mydockerusername`
4. Enter your credentials
5. Click on `Save`

### Connect to GCR (Google Container Registry)

You will need this to pull or push images to Google Container Registry as part of building your project. More details on using GCR is [here](docker_registries.md/#google-container-registry)

2. In the sidebar on the left, expand 'APIs & auth' and select 'Credentials'
3. Click 'Create new Client ID' and select 'Service Account' in the pop-up window
4. Click on 'Create Client ID'. A dialog box appears. To proceed, click 'Okay, got it'
5. Your new Public/Private key pair is generated and downloaded to your machine. Please store this carefully since you will not be able to retrieve this from your GDC account.
6. Now you are ready to integrate with GCR on Shippable. Back to [Shippable](https://shippable.com).
7. Click on Settings and then the Integrations Tab.
8. To add a new integration, click on (+)
9. **Master Integration:** Click on `GCR`

## Tokens

This is where you generate, view and manage access tokens to use our [API](api.md).

- Enter a name for your token
- Click `Generate Token`
- Remember to copy the token. For security reasons, the token will never be displayed again.
- To delete a token, click on the _delete_ icon next to your token name

> **Note**
>
> NEVER commit code containing your API token to a public repository.
> Doing so will compromise the security of your Shippable account. Treat
> your API token like a password
