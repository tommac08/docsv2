# YML Reference

This is a reference page for the various configuration options that can be set in your Shippable YML file.

To learn how to run a build with the most important YML configs, please refer to our
[how to guide on running a build](build_case2.md).

>**NOTE**
>
> By default, we will build all branches of the project as long as there is a shippable.yml in the root of every branch. The YML file is specific to a branch.

### Build matrix

This is a powerful feature that Shippable has to offer. You can
trigger multiple different test passes for a single code push. You might
want to test against different versions of ruby, or different aspect
ratios for your Selenium tests or best yet, just different jdk versions.
You can do it all with Shippable's matrix build mechanism.

```yaml
rvm:
  - 1.8.7 # (current default)
  - 1.9.2
  - 1.9.3
  - rbx
  - jruby
  - ruby-head
  - ree
gemfile:
  - gemfiles/Gemfile.rails-2.3.x
  - gemfiles/Gemfile.rails-3.0.x
  - gemfiles/Gemfile.rails-3.1.x
  - gemfiles/Gemfile.rails-edge
env:
  - ISOLATED=true
  - ISOLATED=false
```

The above example will fire 36 different builds for each push. Whoa!
Need more minions?

### Environment Variables

#### Standard environment variables

The following environment variables are available for every build. You
can use these in your scripts if required:

- BRANCH : Name of branch being built
- BASE_BRANCH : Name of the target branch into which the pull request
  changes will be merged
- BUILD_NUMBER : Build number for current build
- BUILD_URL : Direct URL link to the build output
- CI : true
- CONTINUOUS_INTEGRATION : true
- COMMIT : Commit id that is being built and tested
- COMPARE_URL : A link to GitHub/BitBucket's comparision view for the
  push
- DEBIAN_FRONTEND : noninteractive
- HEAD_BRANCH: Name of the most recently committed branch
- JOB_ID : id of job in Shippable
- LANG : en_US.UTF-8
- LAST_SUCCESSFUL_BUILD_TIMESTAMP : Timestamp of the last
  successful build in seconds. This will be set to **false** for the
  first build or for the build with no prior successful builds
- LC_ALL : en_US.UTF-8
- LC_CTYPE : en_US.UTF-8
- MERB_ENV : test
- PATH : \$HOME/bin:\$PATH
- PULL_REQUEST : Pull request number if the job is a pull request. If
  not, this will be set to **false**
- RACK_ENV : test
- RAILS_ENV : test
- REPO_NAME : Name of the repository currently being built
- REPOSITORY_URL : URL of your Github or Bitbucket repository
- SERVICE_SKIP : false
- SHIPPABLE : true
- SHIPPABLE_ARCHIVE : true
- SHIPPABLE_BUILD_ID : id of build in Shippable
- SHIPPABLE_MYSQL_BINARY : "/usr/bin/mysqld_safe"
- SHIPPABLE_MYSQL_CMD : "\$SHIPPABLE_MYSQL_BINARY"
- SHIPPABLE_POSTGRES_VERSION : "9.2"
- SHIPPABLE_POSTGRES_BINARY :
  "/usr/lib/postgresql/\$SHIPPABLE_POSTGRES_VERSION/bin/postgres"
- SHIPPABLE_POSTGRES_CMD : "sudo -u postgres
  \$SHIPPABLE_POSTGRES_BINARY -c
  "config_file=/etc/postgresql/\$SHIPPABLE_POSTGRES_VERSION/main/postgresql.conf""
- SHIPPABLE_VE_DIR : "\$HOME/build_ve/python/2.7"
- USER : shippable

#### User Specified Environment Variables

You can set your own environment variables in the yml. Every statement
of this command will trigger a separate build with that specific version
of the environment variables.

```yaml
# environment variable
env:
 - FOO=foo BAR=bar
 - FOO=bar BAR=foo
```

> **Note**
>
> Env variables can create an exponential number of builds when combined
> with `jdk` & `rvm , node_js etc.` i.e. it is multiplicative

In this setting **4 individual builds** are triggered in a build group

```yaml
# npm builds
node_js:
  - 0.10.24
  - 0.8.14
env:
  - FOO=foo BAR=bar
  - FOO=bar BAR=foo
```

>**NOTE**
>
> See the prior section on Encrypt Variables on how to secure any environment variables

### Command collections
 `shippable.yml` supports collections under each tag. This is nothing more than YML functionality and we will run it one command at a time.

```yaml
# collection scripts
script:
 - ./minions/do_something.sh
 - ./minions/do_something_else.sh
```

In the example above, our minions will run `./minions/do_something.sh`
and then run `./minions/do_something-else.sh`. The only requirement is
that all of these operations return a `0` exit code. Else the build will
fail.

### Retrying npm install

Sometimes npm install may fail due to the intermittent network issues
and affects your build execution. To avoid this, **shippable_retry**
 will try to install the command again. It will check the return
code of a command and if it is non-zero, then it will re-try to install
up to three times.

**shippable_retry** functionality is available for all default
installation commands and it will re-try to install on failure. You can
also use this functionality for any custom installation from external
resources. For example:

```yaml
before_install:
    - shippable_retry sudo apt-get update
    - shippable_retry sudo apt-get install something
```

### Git submodules

Shippable supports git submodules. This is a cool functionality of
breaking your projects down into manageable chunks. We automatically
initialize the `.gitmodules` file in the root of the repo.

> **Note**
>
> If you are using private repos, add the deploy keys so that our minion
> ssh keys are allowed to pull from the repo. This can be done via
> shippable.com

If its your own public repos then do this

```python
# for public modules use
git://github.com/someuser/somelibrary.git

# for private modules use
git@github.com:someuser/somelibrary.git
```

If you would like to turn submodules off completely -

```yaml
# for public modules use
git:
 submodules: false
```

### Include/Exclude Branches

By default, Shippable builds all branches for enabled repositories as
long as they have a shippable.yml at the root.

You can change this build only specific branches using the include and
exclude sections in your yml. The specific branch that is being included
or excluded needs to have this configuration, and not just the master
branch.

This is because Shippable works as follows - we get a webhook for an
enabled repository letting us know something has changed in a specific
branch. We read the shippable.yml from that branch and then trigger a
build based on that. So if your shippable.yml in the develop branch does
not contain the exclude section, we will trigger a build irrespective of
what's in the yml in master branch.

Here is a sample of the include/exclude config -

```yaml
# exclude
branches:
  except:
    - test1
    - experiment2

# include
branches:
  only:
    - stage
    - prod
```

### Exclude a version

It is also possible to exclude a specific version using exclude tag.
Configure your yml file as shown below to exclude a specific version.

```yaml
matrix:
  exclude:
    - rvm: 1.9.2
```

### Include a version

You can also configure your yml file to include entries into the matrix
with include tag.

```yaml
matrix:
  include:
    - rvm: 2.0.0
      gemfile: gemfiles/Gemfile.rails-3.0.x
      env: ISOLATED=false
```

### Allow-failures

Allowed failures are items in your build matrix that are allowed to fail
without causing the entire build to be shown as failed. You can define
allowed failures in the build matrix as follows:

```yaml
matrix:
  allow_failures:
    - rvm: 1.9.3
```

### Test Results

To set up test result visualization for a repository.

- Output test results to shippable/testresults folder.
- Make sure test results are in junit format.

For example, here is the .yml file for a Python repo -

```yaml
before_script: mkdir -p shippable/testresults
script:
  - nosetests python/sample.py --with-xunit --xunit-file=shippable/testresults/nosetests.xml
```

Examples for other languages can be found in our
[Code Samples](languages/).

### Code Coverage Visualization

To set up code coverage result visualization for a repository.

- Output code coverage output to shippable/codecoverage folder.
- Make sure code coverage output is in cobertura xml format.

For example, here is the .yml file for a Python repo -

```yaml
before_script: mkdir -p shippable/codecoverage
script:
  - coverage run --branch python/sample.py
  - coverage xml -o shippable/codecoverage/coverage.xml python/sample.py
```

Examples for other languages can be found in our Code Samples.

### Notifications

Shippable primarily supports email and irc notifications and these can
can be configured in your yml file. To send Slack notifications, please
check out our [blog post](http://blog.shippable.com/devops-chat-a-simple-way-to-use-slack-notifications-with-shippable).
To send HipChat notifications, check out our [sample project for hipchat notifications](https://github.com/shippableSamples/sample-hipchat-notifications).

By default, we send email notifications to the last committer when a
build fails, or the status changes from failed to passed.

You can change the default settings for email notifications by
configuring the notifications section of your yml. You can specify the
email address(es) where you want to receive notification as well as the
criteria for when you want notifications to be sent.

#### Email notifications

To send notifications to specific email addresses, replace the sample
email addresses below with the recipients' email ids in your
`shippable.yml` file.

```yaml
notifications:
    email:
        - exampleone@org.com
        - exampletwo@org.com
```

You can also specify when you want to get notified by setting the values
for on_success and on_failure keys to change|always|never. Change
means you want to be notified only when the build status changes on the
given branch. Always and never mean you want to be notified always or
never respectively.

```yaml
notifications:
     email:
         recipients:
             - exampleone@org.com
             - exampletwo@org.com
         on_success: change
         on_failure: always
```

If you do not want to get notified for any reason, you can configure
email notifications to false.

```yaml
notifications:
   email: false
```

#### IRC notifications

You can also configure yml file to send build notifications to your IRC
channels.

- To specify single channel

```yaml
notifications:
   irc:  "chat.freenode.net#channel1"
```

- You can also specify multiple server channels in yml file. The
  following formats are supported:

```yaml
notifications:
  irc:
    - "chat.freenode.net#channel1"
    - "chat.freenode.net#channel2"
    - "server1#channel3"
```

```yaml
notifications:
  irc:
   channels:
     - "chat.freenode.net#channel1"
     - "chat.freenode.net#channel2"
     - "server1#channel3"
```

- By default, We will always send build notifications to the mentioned
  channels in yml. **on_success** and **on_failure** are not yet
  configurable.
- IRC notifications are turned off by default for pull request builds.
  However, you can change the default settings by adding
  **pull_requests: true** tag in your yml as shown below.

```yaml
notifications:
  irc:
   pull_requests: true
   channels:
```

### Services

Shippable offers a host of pre-installed services to make it easy to run
your builds. In addition to these you can install other services also by
using the `install` tag of `shippable.yml`.

All the services are turned off by default and can be turned on by using
the `services:` tag.

### Addons

#### Firefox

We support different firefox versions like "18.0", "19.0", "20.0",
"21.0", "22.0", "23.0", "24.0", "25.0", "26.0", "27.0", "28.0", "29.0".
To select a specific firefox version, add the following to your
shippable.yml file.

```yaml
addons:
   firefox: "21.0"
```

#### Custom Host Name

You can also set up custom hostnames using the **hosts** addons. To set
up the hostnames in /etc/hosts file, add the following to your
shippable.yml file.

```yaml
addons:
   hosts:
    - google.com
    - asdf.com
```

#### PostgreSQL

```yaml
# Postgre binds to 127.0.0.1 by default and is started on boot. Default username is "postgres" with no password
# Create a DB as part of before script to use it

before_script:
  - psql -c 'create database myapp_test;' -U postgres
```

Sample java code using
[PostgreSQL](https://github.com/shippableSamples/sample_java_postgres).

We support PostgreSQL 9.1, 9.2 and 9.3 versions and by default, version
9.2 is installed on our minions. Configure your yml file using
**PostgreSQL** addons to select different versions. Add the following to
your yml file to select the version 9.3.

```yaml
addons:
 postgresql : "9.3"
```

PostGIS 2.1 packages are pre-installed in our minions along with the
PostgreSQL versions 9.1, 9.2 and 9.3.

#### Selenium

Selenium is not started on boot. You will have to enable it using
**services** tag and start xvfb (X Virtual Framebuffer) on display port
99.0, so that all your test suites will run on the server without a
display. Configure your yml file as shown below to start selenium server
on firefox.

```yaml
addons:
  firefox: "23.0"

services:
  - selenium

before_script:
  - "export DISPLAY=:99.0"
  - "/etc/init.d/xvfb start"
```

Selenium **2.40** is started by default. You can also select a different
version of selenium using **addons** tag. The following versions are
supported:

- 2.39
- 2.40
- 2.41
- 2.42
- 2.43
- 2.44

Choose the required version and add it to your shippable.yml file as
shown below

```yaml
addons:
  selenium: "2.43"
```

This will download the required version. You will have to include
**services** tag in your yml file to start the selenium server using the
downloaded version. Configure your yml file as shown below to start
selenium server **2.43** on firefox.

```yaml
#specify required selenium and firefox version
addons:
  selenium: "2.43"
  firefox: "27.0"

#start the selenium server
services:
  - selenium

before_script:
  - "export DISPLAY=:99.0"
  - "/etc/init.d/xvfb start"
```

Sample javascript code using
[Selenium](https://github.com/shippableSamples/sample_node_selenium) .
