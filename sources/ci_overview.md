# Overview

Shippable CI/CD is our Continuous Integration and Deployment platform. It uses **Build Minions** which are docker based containers to run your workloads. A couple of common use cases for Shippable CI include:

-  Automating the packaging and deployment of web applications
-  Automated testing and Continuous Integration/Deployment
